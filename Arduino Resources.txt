Android App for Arduino
https://howtomechatronics.com/tutorials/arduino/how-to-build-custom-android-app-for-your-arduino-project-using-mit-app-inventor/
- the app uses MIT APP INVENTOR(.aia), and the sample project is in the repo
- just build the app when you have logged in

Arduino uses the .ino format, and a sample project is in the repo

When using the Serial read, wait for the console, it may take a while to show up

Use softwareserial along with serial to actually READ the value, it is not just serial.read or softwareserial.read
- look in btserialreadtest in the repo

SOME ARDUINOS MAY NOT FUNCTION WITH BLUETOOTH, find the one that works, there is a box that says bt issue, do not use that one

HC05
- constant blinking means it is ready to go
- slow blinking means it is already paired and connected to a device
- DISCONNECT THE TX/RX WIRES FROM ARDUINO WHEN UPLOADING CODE, it will say port in use

HC05 only takes in one byte at a time, difficult to set motors to something that only have 1 byte of data

With a person on the bot, sufficient power is needed to be sent to the bot for it to move
